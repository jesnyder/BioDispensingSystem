v01 - 
First iteration to create a hole pattern using an array, but the hole pattern is not an array. 

v02 - 
Found a tape measure to determine the location of the holes. From those measurements made the model. 
The mounting holes are countersunk to allow the printhead to seat flat against the bracket.
Added three rows of mounting holes to place the bracket to mount the dispensing tip. 
The position and tolerance of the holes must be checked. Consider converting these holes to hexagons (6-sided).
