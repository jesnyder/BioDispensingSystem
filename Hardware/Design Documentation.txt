Design documentation for the 3D bioprinting accessory
by Jessica E. Snyder

Thursday August 22, 2019 
There are four components to make the 3D printer a bioprinter:

1. Printhead Mounting Plate: (Material: PLA) To attach the printhead to the motion system. 
This requires a flat plate with a hole pattern that matches the three carriages and bolts to the tread. 
Additionally, an array of holes to secure the printhead to the plate.  

2. Printhead template: (Material: Water soluble 3D printing filament). The template to make the printhead. Design TBD. 
Based on the SMMB.

3. Syring Pump :

4. Syringe Pump Clamp 


Items for purchase: 
Lead screw
Hex nut
Guide rod
Spring coupling


Optional
Motor 
Audrino
Motor shield

11:19: On printing the coupling, after 5 mm of good printing, the extrusion stopped. 
On looking up trouble shooting, again grinding gears came up as a problem.

13:18: After printing the coupling adaptor for the spring coupling and the motor stem - 
the inner diameter to seat the coupling was too small and the hole to fit the motor stem too large. 
The following edits were made to the design and version changed.

coulpling_od v03: 24 mm v04: 26 mm 
motor_shaft  v03: 7.5 mm v04: 7.0 mm
no changes made to the chamfer on the motor stem. 

13:25 Begin printing of syringe pump base v01 
13:31 Canceled, the first layer was irregular and the print time 18 hrs - 
insufficient time and I changed the layer height - from 0.2 to 0.19 and reduced the speed further.
Trying to eliminate gaps in the build. 

13:32 Cleaned the build plate with 409 and sprayed with hair spray while the plate was heating. 

13:41 Started the build of the coupling v04 - no extrusion. So I stopped and ran 10 mm extruded at 10 mm/min. 
This could be a necessary step. Killed printed and restarted.
