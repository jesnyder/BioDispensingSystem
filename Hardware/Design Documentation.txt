Design documentation for the 3D bioprinting accessory
by Jessica E. Snyder

Thursday August 22, 2019 
There are four components to make the 3D printer a bioprinter:

1. Printhead Mounting Plate: (Material: PLA) To attach the printhead to the motion system. 
This requires a flat plate with a hole pattern that matches the three carriages and bolts to the tread. 
Additionally, an array of holes to secure the printhead to the plate.  

2. Printhead template: (Material: Water soluble 3D printing filament). The template to make the printhead. Design TBD. 
Based on the SMMB.

3. Syring Pump :

4. Syringe Pump Clamp 


Items for purchase: 
Lead screw
Hex nut
Guide rod
Spring coupling


Optional
Motor 
Audrino
Motor shiled

11:19: On printing the coupling, after 5 mm of good printing, the extrusion stopped. 
On looking up trouble shooting, again grinding gears came up as a problem.

13:18: After printing the coupling adaptor for the spring coupling and the motor stem - 
the inner diameter to seat the coupling was too small and the hole to fit the motor stem too large. 
The following edits were made to the design and version changed.

coulpling_od v03: 24 mm v04: 26 mm 
motor_shaft  v03: 7.5 mm v04: 7.0 mm
no changes made to the chamfer on the motor stem.
